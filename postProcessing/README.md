Moody installation

Moody itself is released in pre-compiled form, however the API coupling code
is released open source. Therefore (as of v.2.0.1), only the binaries are packed
in .tar.gz files for each operating system (OSX, Linux and Windows). The com
pressed files includes the etc, bin, lib and include folders. The tutorials, the
manual and the API are all accessed directly as sources when cloning the reposi
tory.

  1. Clone or download the repository from github.com/johannep/moodyAPI.
  2. Select your installation directory and unpack the appropriate tar-file bina
     ries IN THE SAME LOCATION. Technically, this is only relevant for all
     tutorials and matlab-processing paths to work as intended.
  3. In Linux or OSX environments, source the environment variables. For this,
     use etc/bashrcMoody. NB: There is no Windows PATH-setting script
     provided at this time.
